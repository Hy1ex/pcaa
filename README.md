# per-Client sv_airaccelerate
This plugin allows the admin to set sv_airaccelerate value per Client.

## Compilation Dependencies:
- MultiColor Library and Sub libraries (Included)(Special Version Only)
- Standard Sourcemod Libraries

## Required to Run:
- [Metamod 1.10+](https://www.metamodsource.net/)
- [Sourcemod 1.11+](https://sourcemod.net) (1.11 is recommended but the plugin should work on later versions too)

## Convars
| Console variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **sm_pcaa_adminflag** | ``Admin flag for PCAA panel/menu access.`` |
| **sm_pcaa** | ``Opens PCAA management menu.`` |

## Todo
- Probably fix the lastest version of multicolors and switch the current one for that but for now it works fine.

## Note
You must use the MultiColors the special version that is included in source code
to compile because I'm to lazy to make a proper fix for MultiColors. Don't think so much 
special version is nothing big it's the same as included in client api plugin but some lines in code
are commented because of compilation errors.
